                            "I've been using this car since last year I'll divide my review between the pros and cons Pros:- Good power High-speed Good road presence, Smooth acceleration, Good braking, Can fit 6 people if they scooch a little. Cons:- A little bumpy at high speeds starts shaking above 300kmph, Very low mileage, High maintenance cost, Parts availability, Low ground clearance, Too noisy, No cover or seat cover with the car. AC is very slow, Spaceless Build quality and safety very poor. "
